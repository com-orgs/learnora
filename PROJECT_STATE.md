# Learnora Project State

Checkpoint: 5 November 2026
Production: https://learnora-ab2.pages.dev/
Repository: https://github.com/com-orgs/learnora

## Completed
- Grade 6 source-code QA sample expanded to 9 lesson pages.
- 45/45 quiz answer-key mappings match visible question answer choices.
- Dedicated source heading present on 6/9 sampled lessons; absent on Algebraic Expressions, Integers and the Number Line, and Order of Operations.
- Firecrawl current balance checked: 0 credits. No crawl/scrape or paid operation initiated.
- No GSC inspections, no manual Request Indexing, no production edits and no deployment.
- PROJECT_STATUS.md and master roadmap updated with the new findings.

## Files inspected in latest batch
- math/grade-6/algebraic-expressions.html
- scripts/pages/math-grade-6-algebraic-expressions.js
- math/grade-6/integers-number-line.html
- scripts/pages/math-grade-6-integers-number-line.js
- math/grade-6/order-of-operations.html
- scripts/pages/math-grade-6-order-of-operations.js
- math/grade-6/understanding-percentages.html
- scripts/pages/math-grade-6-understanding-percentages.js

## Blockers
- GSC tracker hourly background checks remain active; connector exposes no pause/throttle action. Daily GSC cap remains exceeded on 5 Nov.
- Complete source-section inventory across all 77 lessons is not yet recounted.
- Three sampled lessons need source-attribution review.
- Source-code key consistency does not replace mathematical validation, browser testing or independent educator review.
- Firecrawl credits are at zero; use GitHub source inspection until credits return or owner authorizes another free method.

## Next actions
1. Review exact claims and add suitable sources for the three flagged Grade 6 lessons, on a preview branch only.
2. Recalculate worked examples and worksheet answer keys for these topics.
3. Recount source headings across all 77 lesson files before reporting a site-wide percentage.
4. Run browser and live-fetch QA when an authenticated browser context or free crawl capacity is available.
5. Keep production unchanged until explicit QA and release gates pass.
